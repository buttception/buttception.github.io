Hi, I'm Devin, a passionate graphics programmer and game engine developer. I specialize in real-time rendering, engine architecture, and low-level graphics programming. My work involves building efficient, high-performance rendering pipelines, optimizing shaders, and creating tools that empower artists and developers.

I have experience working with OpenGL, NVRHI, DirectX12, and Unreal Engine 5, developing custom renderers, and implementing advanced rendering techniques like PBR lighting, cascade shadow mapping, and DLSS upscaling. I also focus on multithreaded rendering, asset management, and designing editor tools for game engines.

What drives me is the challenge of making real-time graphics both visually stunning and highly optimized. Whether it's refining a render pipeline, tackling complex performance bottlenecks, or developing new rendering techniques, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible in interactive graphics.

Feel free to explore my work, and if you're interested in collaborating or discussing rendering tech, letâ€™s connect!
